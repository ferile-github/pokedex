# Pokedex
A Pokemon Pokedex created by Andy Fairlie, using React, Next.js 13, Tailwind CSS

I spent way too much time delving into Pokemon stats, like how much does a Pokemon actually weigh?


## How to install
Just run `yarn` and then `yarn dev` to run the dev server. I have included the .env file on purpose, which I usually wouldn't do.


## Things I would have liked to add with more time:
- Better Pagination controls, to handle going to a specific page
- Creation of single pages for each Pokemon, and display more stats for each creature
- Addition of generateStaticParams to build the static site
- Better mobile device experience
