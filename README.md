# Pokedex
A Pokemon Pokedex created by Andy Fairlie, using React, Next.js 13, Tailwind CSS

I spent way too much time delving into Pokemon stats, like how much does a Pokemon actually weigh?


## How to install
Just run `yarn` and then `yarn dev` to run the dev server


## Things I would have liked to add with more time:
- Pagination between all 1200 Pokemon. Yes I didnt realise there were that many!
- Creation of single pages for each Pokemon, and display more stats for each creature
- Addition of prop types for all the data
- Addition of ServerSideProps to build the static site
